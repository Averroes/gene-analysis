# Viewing data #

## Viewing newly generated data ##

  * If the gene data has been recently generated and is still in the gene queue, the generated data can be viewed by clicking the **View generated data** button below the analysis status messages.
    * If the button is not appearing, ensure that the desired gene is selected in the queue and that it has successfully been analysed (ie. has not encountered an error).
  * A window of the data will open. This data can be filtered by certain key letters, or re-ordered by the different columns.

## Viewing recently generated or viewed data ##

  * Recently generated or viewed data can be found in the **File** > **Recent Data** menu. Simply clicking on the appropriate gene name will open the data viewing window.

## Viewing previously generated data ##

  * If the data was not recently generated, it can still be viewed using **File** > **Open data**.
  * The folder containing the generated data must then be chosen.
  * If a valid data folder has been chosen, the data viewing window will open, and the gene will be stored in the **Recent Data** menu.
