= Introduction =

This Program is an innitative of Dr. Michael Gantier, for his research with genetics.

= Details =

The purpose of this program is to provide data that represents the most relevant TF sites and mirna binding sites specific to a gene to the user. Based on these, users may be able to determine other genes with simmilar functions.

The Enrichment Score produced is a factor of relevance, being the amount of genes that a miRNA targets with a TF, divided by the total amound of genes for that miRNA. This gives an indication of how relevant the two factors are to each other.
