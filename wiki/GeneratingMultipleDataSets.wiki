  # Multiple genes can be added to the queue easily by simply typing them all into the textbox labelled *Gene Name*.
    * Each gene should be separated by either a space, comma, tab or newline character
  # The output location can be changed, as long as _[gene]_ is included. For each gene added to the queue, _[gene]_ will be replaced with the relevant gene name.
  # The *Add to queue* button can be pressed, adding all genes to the queue assuming they are properly separated.
  # Now in the gene, the analysis of the genes can be carried out as detailed [http://code.google.com/p/gene-analysis/wiki/GeneratingData here].
