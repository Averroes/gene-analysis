# Generating Data for Multiple Genes #

## Filling out the form ##

  1. Multiple genes can be added to the queue easily by simply typing them all into the textbox labelled **Gene Name**.
    * Each gene should be separated by either a space, comma, tab or newline character
  1. The output location can be changed, as long as _[gene](gene.md)_ is included. For each gene added to the queue, _[gene](gene.md)_ will be replaced with the relevant gene name.
  1. The **Add to queue** button can be pressed, adding all genes to the queue assuming they are properly separated.
  1. Now in the gene, the analysis of the genes can be carried out as detailed [here](http://code.google.com/p/gene-analysis/wiki/GeneratingData).
